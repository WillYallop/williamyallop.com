## Introduction

Anyrep is an appliance repairs company based in Norwich, and it just so happens that's owned and run by my Dad. As such, I can't leave him without a modern, responsive and SEO-optimised website.

This is now the fourth iteration of this site I've built for Anyrep, and this time around I wanted to focus on the basics. That means no half-baked store functionality, no complex booking form and no crazy design. Just a simple, informative site that explains the services and funnels people towards a booking form that doesn't bombard users with never-ending questions.

Overall this build went super well! The tech stack made development a breeze and Netlify made hosting so simple its hard to imagine having went another route for it.

Due to the simple design and powerful stack, adding more complex features in the future should be super easy and hopefully delays the inevitable V5!
